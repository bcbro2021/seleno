## What is an esolang? ðŸ¤”
An esolang, short for "esoteric programming language," is a type of programming language<br>
that is intended more as a joke or a puzzle than as a useful tool. Programmers often design<br>
esoteric programming languages to challenge themselves, investigate novel and <br>
unorthodox approaches to writing code, or push the limits of what is deemed "normal" programming languages.<br>
